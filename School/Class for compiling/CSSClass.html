<h1>Popular Programming Languages</h1>
<p>Two kinds of programming languages are compieled and scripting. Compiled language code is first processed by a compiler, 
    which produces an executable for you to run.
     Scripting language is still compiled first but it is compiled "on the fly", and is immediately run for you.</p>
