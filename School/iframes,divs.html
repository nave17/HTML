 <h1>What Makes Octopuses so Interesting?</h1>
 <hr>
 <h2>Intelligence</h2>
 <p>
 Octopuses are extremely intelligent. They have been known to
 solve complex problems in captivity. They play with toys and
 are great escape artists. They can recognize particular people
 and display emotions, such as anger.
 </p>

<hr>


 <h2>Color Shifting</h2>
 <p>
 Chameleons aren't the only animals with color shifting skin!
 Octopuses are able to change the color and texture of their
 skin at will. This makes them great camouflage artists, which
 in turn makes them hard to find and dangerous predators!
 </p>

<hr>


 <h2>Anatomy</h2>
 <p>
 Octopuses have three hearts, eight arms, suckers on their arms,
 a highly developed central nervous system, a beak, and a siphon.
 </p>
 The siphon is used for movement, to shoot ink, and to draw water
 over the octopus's gills to breathe.
 <p>
 </p>
 Two of the octopus's hearts pump blood to their gills, while the
 third handles pumping blood to the rest of the body.
 <p>
 </p>
 The octopus has arms, not tentacles! Each arm is covered with
 very sensitive suckers that send tactile and taste information
 back to the brain. The octopus can feel and taste with his suckers!
