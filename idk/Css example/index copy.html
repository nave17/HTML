  <h1 id="Reef">Great Barrier Reef</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center; color: #E02079;">"THE GREAT BARRIER REEF IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES YOU MUST VISIT, 
    WHETHER YOU LOVE THE WATER OR JUST WANT TO SEE ONE OF THE GREAT WONDERS OF THE WORLD."</h2><h3 style="text-align: center; color: #ee3d8f;">-Chris Hemsworth, actor and Global Ambassador for Tourism Australia</h3>
    <br>
  <p style="margin: 2px 5px 2px 5px;">The Great Barrier Reef was the first coral reef system to be designated as a World Heritage Site,
     having met all four natural criteria for inclusion. The reef is the biggest living structure on the planet, 
     and it can even be viewed from space! With over 100 lovely islands strewn over the reef to explore, 
     it is one of Australia's most popular attractions. With rainbow-colored corals and a diversity of marine creatures to observe up close, the snorkelling and diving possibilities are among the greatest in the world. The region is also culturally significant to the local Aboriginal people,
     who have handed down legends about the reef's formation down the years.</p>
     <h2>Things to do and attractions at the Great Barrier Reef</h2>
     <h3>Cruise Michaelmas Cay</h3>
     <p style="margin: 2px 5px 2px 5px;">Reef Cruise, a 32-metre (105-foot) high-performance catamaran,
       it will take you to the Great Barrier Reef in luxury. It sails from Cairns to Michaelmas Cay,
        a beautiful coral sand island off the coast of Queensland. 
        You may dive and snorkel the reef among the turtles and colourful fish, sunbathe on the deck, 
        or take a semi-submersible coral viewing trip. Michaelmas Cay is also home to over 23 different seabird species,
       making it one of the Great Barrier Reef's most important bird sanctuaries.</p>

    <h1 id="bay">Byron Bay</h1>
    <p style="margin: 2px 5px 2px 5px;">Byron Bay was a peaceful little industrial town with a
       little stench of meat in the air thanks
       to the local slaughterhouse and whaling station half a century ago. Today, 
      Australia's most easterly point in northern New South Wales is a popular tourist attraction,
       with over 2 million people each year.</p>
    <h2>The Atmosphere</h2>
    <p style="margin: 2px 5px 2px 5px;">Byron Bay is known for its distinct atmosphere,
       which is an important element of the "Byron" experience. Many local hippies and street artists can be seen all around town,
        and there is usually something going on. Walking through the streets,
         you'll notice little colourful stores and dining establishments that reflect Byron Bay's unconventional lifestyle.
          When you combine the incredibly easygoing environment, the Byron Bay people, the numerous pubs and clubs,
       and the thriving live music scene, it's difficult not to have a good time in Bryon Bay!</p>
       <h2>Surfing</h2>
       <p style="margin: 2px 5px 2px 5px;">Byron Bay has 9 outstanding surfing beaches, for which it is internationally known; 
        ‘The Pass’ lies directly next to the world famous Lighthouse and is a very popular surfspot, 
        ‘The wreck’ which is good for beginner surfers, then you have the main beach, Belongil beach, Watego’s and little Watego’s,
         ‘the Cosy Corner’ which is protected by the Arakwal National Park, Clarkes Beach 
         which is great for paragliding and last but not least ‘Tallows beach’ which is really good for beach fishing.
